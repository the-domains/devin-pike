# A New Start

I haven't been keeping up with my personal site in quite a few months. Part of that comes from not doing much writing outside of extended posts on Facebook. (I'll let your snickering and eye-rolling die down. Okay. Moving on.) Part of my list of things I wanted to accomplish in 2016 was to revitalize my creative process, redo my site, and start writing again, to get a few of these things rattling around in my head out into the wild..

This morning, I got notification that my beta membership for The Grid finally kicked in. I've been waiting for The Grid for over a year, while they worked out the kinks of an AI-driven design engine and ten times the amount of "early adopters" like me pounding on the door to be let in.

So, in the coming weeks, I'll be porting over my older content, as well as articles I salvaged from the archives of Red Carpet Crash and DeadLaszlo. I'll also be posting like crazy whenever I see a great piece of content that deserves a signal boost, or a crowdfunding project that I feel you'd appreciate hearing about.

After all, this is about you as well as me.

Cheers.
