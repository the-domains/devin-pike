# A Single Request For The New Year

Rather than tell you that 2016 will be better than 2015, I'm going to make a request of each of you to think about in the next twelve months.

Be kind.

Kind to the people you see every day, because they're slugging it out every day, just like you are.

Kind to the people you encounter randomly, because their struggle might just need a little bit of courtesy to make it turn the corner.

Kind to your family and friends, because snark and sarcasm may be amusing 99 percent of the time, but sometimes that barb might find a place where there is no armor.

Kind to the people who you may not agree with, or understand. THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT in Election Season.

Kind to yourself, because you can be the harshest person inside your head.

2015 has been a massive year of change for me, and 2016 will be a fairly big transition. I'm focusing on my career, and dialing back_\*\*\*A LOT\*\*\*_on working at shows and conventions. This is a good thing, but it means I likely won't see a lot of you as much as I'd like.

If that's the case, and our paths don't cross, I sincerely hope 2016 is kind to you.

Cheers. Sláinte. Salud. Skål. L'chaim. Kanpai. Fe sahetek. Prost. Ziggy.

Happy New Year.
