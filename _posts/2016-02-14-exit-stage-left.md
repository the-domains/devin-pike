# Exit, Stage Left

Since I was fighting my way through it (with the help of [Ben Ambroso][0] as my Anger Translator), I thought I would share the message I delivered Saturday night \[October 8, 2015\] at [Dallas Comic Con][1] Fandays.

"For ten years, I've had the distinct honor of hosting the Dallas Comic Con Costume Contests. As the shows, and the contests, have grown in size, it has been a pure delight in watching the talent-level increase to unheard-of levels.

"It is with great sadness, and reluctance, that this will be the final DCC event I'll be emceeing.

"With the schedule limitations of a new job, and the increasing physical demands of the shows, it's time for me to step aside.

"My message to you, the costuming and cosplayer community, is a simple one:

"As your numbers grow, and new folks begin to flex their creative muscles, you need to remember when you were first starting out. Be inclusive, and supportive. Don't be the reason people leave cosplay --- be the reason they go further.

"I'll be looking in, from time to time, to keep in touch with the amazing friends I have made along the way in the community.

"In closing, Imperator Joe, hit me. WITNESS ME! WITNESS!!!"

I won't turn this into a tagfest, but I would be remiss if I didn't express absolute gratitude to [Mark Walters][2] and [Ben Stevens][3] for allowing me to hijack a portion of your shows --- and ignoring the occasional complaint from attendees when things got a little raucous. THANK YOU.

What people don't understand about [Jenn Rohm][4] is her ability to keep me on track and functioning for the entirety of a Convention --- and how absolutely, ridiculously difficult that can be. I will never be able to comprehend why she wanted that gig, but I do know I will always be grateful for it.

To answer a frequent question: my decision to step away from the hosting world means just that --- I won't be hosting panels at conventions, and my gigs at Alamo Drafthouse will also be dialed back as well. It's time to let other folks hog the spotlight.

In closing this chapter of my career, I leave behind a phenomenal group of friends that I've accumulated. When people ask me why I got so emotional at the end of Saturday's contest, it's knowing I would see them all less. Things change, we move along down the road. I carry you in my heart.

...except for you, Ambroso. You can catch the next bus.
