48 days ago, Rangers General Manager Jon Daniels told a room full of Newberg Report Ã¼berfans the following, that has echoed in my head ever since:

"Wild card, whatever. I really think we can win the division."

At that point, we were still in the afterglow from signing Cole Hamels - but we were looking at the aforementioned Wild Card berth as a possibility. The team had been surging, and were four games back from Houston for the division lead.

Still, wrapping our collective heads around sealing the deal and taking the division title took a little work.

And 162 games. Not one inning less.

It took the management of Jeff Banister. It took Adrian Beltre hitting any damned ball that came his way. It took Shin-Soo Choo and Prince Fielder playing the way we knew they were capable of when we acquired them. It took Elvis Andrus and Roughned Odor getting lethal - and dumping Powerade on the whole damned team.

The American League Divisional Series between the Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays - featuring the probable AL MVP, Josh Donaldson - looms later in the week. Until that first pitch gets thrown, I plan on basking in this one for a couple of days.
