# Goodnight, Steve

The first time I used an Apple computer was in Randy Vonderheid's Journalism class at DeSoto High School, in 1986\. Mr. V had seen the writing on the wall, and knew that the future workplace for writers and newspaper folk would be digital. Sure, we knew how to use the pica pole to measure out headline distances, and proportion wheels to properly crop and size photographs... but those days would be in the past, not the future. Programs like the first version of Aldus' PageMaker would be the way things went from here on out.

In the last 15 years, I've owned no fewer than six Apple Macintosh computers. The first one was a Macintosh IIci that I bought from a co-worker at The Imaging Bureau. The thing was outdated when I bought it -- it ran a 33MHz 603e chip, with (after I cracked open the case) 16MB of memory, and a 240MB hard drive. With that Mac, named Ishmael, I made my first series of web pages (the predecessor of The Dead Laszlo Chronicles), began screwing around with image creation and manipulation, and figured out that my professional career -- the one I would lean on once I was too old to work in bars anymore -- would be a digital one.

I owe so much to Steve Jobs.

Not because he ever knew who I was, or gave a damn about some guy who was teaching himself a new career with a computer his company made.

No, I owe him because he had conviction of vision. Determination that the course he had laid out in his head for Apple was the right one. And when he came storming back into Cupertino and reclaimed the company he started in a garage with Steve Wozniak, he knew that there were millions of people like me who wanted their technology -- not just computers, but the other devices Apple looked at and said "We can do this better" -- to just work. Technology that got out of your way and allowed you to create. Relax. Share.

Like so many around the world, I feel a sense of loss over the death of Steve Jobs. Not because I knew the man, but for what his passing means. He was a titan. A generational touchstone. A person synonymous with his industry, and someone we felt connected to, in the same was we identify and relate to athletes, musicians or actors.

With those folks, we watch their work, and allow ourselves to have an emotional response, ending the interaction. With Jobs, we watched him work, and then went to work with the products of his vision. (And Jon Ive, and Phil Schiller, and the legions of developers, engineers, and other staffers at Apple.) Once a football game is over, very few people then take a Jason Witten jersey and go try to get signed on to an NFL team.

Tomorrow morning, I'm going to go into work, hop on a Mac Pro, and edit some video clips. That's my job. Once I'm done there, I'll head over to Livid Lobster, and use my Macbook Pro to prepare for my weekly show with Matt Mungle. I'm not saying that, without Steve Jobs' work, I wouldn't be doing exactly the same thing. But I do know that's an alternate reality I want no part of.

Goodnight, Steve. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
