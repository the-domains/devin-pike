## And I Greet Them With The Widest Smile

Okay, I've hung on to this footage for more than three months, because of two simple facts:

* I sound bad.
* I look bad.

The audio on the clip is straight from the sound board, and I'm telling you (and have had this confirmed by people with nothing to gain by lying) I sounded a lot better than this clip makes it out to be.

Meanwhile, had I not seen myself in this video, I wouldn't have been as motivated to lose the weight I'm losing now. That's not just a muffin-top I've got working -- it's a full on undulating waistline overflow. Bleargh!

So, with all that said, here's the footage of Masters of Nun performing live at the House of Blues.
