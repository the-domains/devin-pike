# Meeting 'Manda

_I originally posted this during Blogathon 2006\. On our second wedding anniversary, I thought it would be apropos to repost it. I've been an amazingly lucky man in my years with Manda, and I can only hope to make her as happy as she's made me._

Amanda says I get too long-winded in telling this story, but you know I love a good tale. It starts at City Streets, in Fort Worth, on Friday, 29 July 2005\.

I had finally gotten a job that would allow me to get out of DJ work, a career I had pretty much had my fill of. It was my last weekend at the Blue Monkey Lounge, and I damn near didn't show up for that night of work. Stupid dumb work ethic.

While I didn't always follow my own advice, I tried to quit dating women I've met in bars. It never ended well. I broke this rule at my own peril... literally.

And, laws, did I hate bachlorette parties. There's always a mindset within the participants that the room belongs to them, and regardless of the demands, they'll have their way or hell will be dished out.

So, I was predisposed to dislike Erin and Amanda. They were the advance guard of Tanika's bachlorette extravaganza, and were saving the big table. Amanda turned in a song, and in short order Ray handed me her slip.

"Really. She's serious? Okay. Mandalicious, come on up."

Stage names like that never bode well.

I then got a gander of the song she was singing. "Run-Around" by Blues Traveler? Easily one of the hardest songs we had in our catalog. I was thoroughly skeptical, and it came through in my introduction of her.

The track starts, and she nails it. Completely.

I was stunned. Gabberflasted.

Ray saw my look, and says to me, "She's pretty good, huh?"

I pick my jaw off the floor, and regain a bit of my composure. "Yeah, but she hasn't hit the second verse yet." I cross my arms and wait. The second verse rolls around... and it's better than the first.

The song ends, and the crowd gives her a good reaction. I stop her, and quiet the applause. "Folks, she just picked on of the hardest songs we have, and nailed it. Please give her another round of applause."

In the middle of the clapping, she leans towards me, grabs my shirt front and pulls me close. She whispers in my ear, "There's a reason they call me Mandalicious." She lets go, leaving me standing on the stage, slack-jawed.

I had no idea what I was getting myself into.

We introduced ourselves properly after I started the next singer, and told Ray I was taking a break. We talked throughout the night, slow-danced to something good... kissed outside the bar.

I cornered Erin later in the night and said, "Tell me everything, now." Erin replied, "She's single. She likes you. Don't fuck it up."

As the night ended, I was invited to breakfast with the bachlorette party at an all-night joint called the Old South Pancake House --- usually not a good thing, but everyone in the party dug me.

Erin hadn't eaten anything substantial for the whole evening, so when she got to Old South, she was on the verge of hypoglycemic shock. I wound up taking care of her --- "Hey, can I get another pitcher of orange juice here, please?" --- while trying to get to know Amanda more. She's a microbiologist, had been in and out of serious relationships for a while, and was open to dating again.

I wanted to spend a lot more time with her... but the whole thing was screwy. She had a wedding the next day, and I was leaving for Los Angeles for a week and a half he following Tuesday.

We sat there after figuring out we wouldn't see each other for a couple of weeks. She batted her eyelashes at me.

"Your timing sucks."

On the road trip out to Los Angeles, Amanda and I messaged each other through our phones at least twenty times a day. I'm not exaggerating.

By the second day, everyone was tired of hearing about Amanda, with the exception of Richard's wife. She would see my face light up when Amanda would text message me, and she would start in immediately.

"Is that your lovah?" I would answer back non-chalantly at first, but after a while, the idea grew on me. "I hope so," I started to respond.

That Saturday, I sequestered myself away from the rest of the group to do Blogathon. Being two time zones away, Amanda messaged cutely, "I'm two hours ahead -- want to know how it ends?"

I messaged back, "We fall madly in love and live snappily ever after."

It was the first time I had really given any thought to a serious relationship with her, and was totally fine with it. I didn't know it at the time, but she was as well.

Now, being Los Angeles, and being out on a Wild Ass Circus trip, I could have gotten in a whole lot of trouble that week... but something held me back. Something wonderful was waiting for me back in Texas. I had no idea what, but at least I knew it. Now, i only had to not screw it up.
