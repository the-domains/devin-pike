# Prove It All Night

We've got the technology, on a consumer level, to create some amazing entertainment. For $30,000, we can shoot, edit and distribute feature-length films that are ready to go on a big screen. This also allows fans who take issue with the cut and clarity of existing films and TV shows to go in and alter the tone, pacing and content of anything, from THE PHANTOM MENACE and STAR TREK: THE FINAL FRONTIER to the final episodes of LOST and HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.

And, it has got to **stop**.

I have zero issue with people who dislike Jar-Jar Binks, or the twist ending of HIMYM. All art, and perception of same, is subjective. But just because you can go back in and delete entire sequences from pieces \*doesn't mean you should.\* If you really,**really** hate the way a show goes, instead of taking a straight razor to the work of dozens of actors, writers, directors, editors, et al... PROVE THAT YOU CAN DO A BETTER JOB AND MAKE YOUR OWN DAMNED SHOW.

I mean it. You've already proven you have the capability to edit video (in some cases, pretty well). Time to put the rest of your hobbyist time where your mouse is. Write a script -- or, rather, take the time to learn what it takes to write a 22-minute sitcom script. Cast it, with people who know how to deliver lines without chewing excessive amounts of scenery. Shoot it, with decent lights and solid sound.

Once you're done, post it online. Encourage people you've never met, and have no reason to blow sweet nothings in your ear, to watch it and give their unvarnished opinion of the product of weeks of your spare time. Then, when they suggest that you completely remove the second act because it doesn't "ring true" and question your choices on **just about everything else**... I think you get the idea.

Watch your shows. Enjoy them, or rail against them, to your hearts' content. Just stop hacking them up and patting yourself on the back when you think you've done a better job.
