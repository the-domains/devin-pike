# Up All Night

Two weeks ago, I was pleased to see [three guys go after the Guinness World Record for longest TV watching marathon][0], by chain-watching all six seasons of "Lost" prior to the series finale. This gave me the notion to try and break a record I've had in my sights for quite a while: the Longest On-Air Radio Shift.

The record currently sits at 120 hours, set by [Suresh Joachim][1] on Canadian radio in June 2003\. Joachim is a serial record breaker, holding the Guinness marks for over 60 different things like ironing, the largest bridal party, and longest distance on a treadmill.

Now, bear in mind, I've pulled a lot of all-nighters in my 40 years. The run-ups to Live Aid and Hands Across America were multi-day stretches without sleep. In my Twenties, there were full weekends without the slightest hint of snoozing -- and a few of them were while drinking, which is supposed to make you groggier as the day progresses. I've pulled three different shifts for the Blogathon, where you blog for 24 hours straight at 30-minute intervals.

Well, after last night, Suresh can breathe a little easier... because there's no way in hell this year's model of Devin can go for six days without sleep. He barely lasted one.

The dress rehearsal for [The Runsheet][2] Thursday night ran until midnight, after which I went in to my new video editing gig to get my hours for the day. Following that, I did my usual Friday morning radio row appearances with [Rich Hancock at Rational Broadcasting][3], and [Pugs & Company on CNN 1190 Dallas][4]. By the end of Pugs' show, right around noon, I was begging for death. While I did make it home safely, I had an even more stupid idea, to attempt to stay up a little longer to balance out my sleep schedule (and not sleep away the remainder of the day. This lasted all of three hours, and I crashed for a three-hour nap. Around 6:00 pm, I woke back up, had dinner with Manda, watched the majority of the Rangers / Rays game, then crashed again, waking up at 7:00 am Saturday.

Kids, there's a moral to this story -- and I'm mostly telling it to myself, to document this little escapade for the part of me that, around November, will start thinking of the six day radio shift for charity (and to set the record in the process). Because I know myself. Too well. By Halloween or so, I'll start thinking "if I can prepare properly, and do a lot of caffeination, I can make it through a week."

**No, Future Devin, you bloody well _can not_.**

You're going to be 40 years old in a month, and you simply can not handle the physical strain on that kind of level. It's a wonderful idea, and one that would be a great PR stunt for whatever projects you find yourself entwined in at that time. You'd likely raise a lot of money for whatever charity you attached yourself to. **However**, you're overweight, have had a couple of heart issues, and aren't built for that kind of marathon.

Perhaps, if you start preparing now -- by losing the weight _and keeping it off_, doing some light jogging and the weight training that you have the equipment for in your garage yet collects dust and boxes -- you can think about this for December 2011\. Past that, get the idea out of your head. Really.
