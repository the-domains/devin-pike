# What Is Six Times Nine?

42\.

There was a time, seven or eight years ago, where I would have been able to rattle off a long diatribe on how the 22-year-old version of Devin Pike was light years apart from the 42-year-old. Thinner, easily. More focused? Hardly. Volatile? I wonder.

Which rabbit hole do I really want to go down this evening? I was compelled to get out of bed, and write ... something. When I was walking into the living room, to hop onto my computer, I was going to say that it was so much easier to write several years ago. I think there are two things that have fundamentally changed the way I get stuff out of my brain: social media, and marriage.

Social media's the easy one. Rather than a better, more-thought-out diatribe, I'll post it on Twitter or Facebook. (Except the politically-charged thought bubbles. Lately, I've grown damned weary of both sides of the argument. I'm still a lefty, but the vast number of my friends who are on the opposite aisle wouldn't appreciate it, and I don't have the energy to argue with them anymore.I'm not going to convert anyone these days, and preaching to the choir is just peeing in warm corduroy pants.)

Explaining marriage is also pretty easy, in this context. Rather than rant about something, I really just want to tell Manda when I see her next. She's an exemplary foil in these conversations, as her view is often markedly different from mine on several fronts. It's one thing I miss keenly when we're away from each other for an extended period of time, and things just don't seem quite_real_until I can share it with her.

Was that what I wanted to get out of bed and write? Doubtful. It's more likely that I just wanted to ...write. I haven't done a freeform blog post -- or, truthfully, **any blog post **-- in so freaking long. It's comforting I can still string a sentence together.

A note on my weight: I've been damned lax with my diet and exercise -- especially in the last two weeks, when a spate of lower back spasms kicked in. I'm under doctor's orders to hold off on any workouts until... tomorrow. At that point, I'll get back on the program. This means renewed dates with my Elliptical Mistress, daily caloric counts, and just being smarter. Again. I had a good start; it's time to correct my course for a goal line.

Do I like the person I am now, at age 42?

...

No. I don't.

I've become complacent, sometimes even fearful. I walk on eggshells when I need to be forceful, and I bellow and snarl when I should back the hell off. My timing sucks. (Probably has for a while now, but I'm more keenly aware of it now.) I still don't have any clue what makes me tick, and what I do know pisses me off, and sometimes disgusts me. I have a wonderful wife, great job, amazing friends, and**no clue whatsoever**. I deluded myself, probably all of my life, that I had a plan. A series of plans. When one plan would fade out, another would rise up, like a fresh target on a pivot at at shooting gallery. Is the goal I have now waiting for a BB to come along? Dammit,**what is it**?

Here's what I do know I want to do:

* I want to be a better husband. More attentive, more loving, a stronger provider
* I want to have some sort of legacy. This means leaving something behind that will carry on after I'm gone, whether it's a child, or a body of work.
* I don't want to live in fear of loss anymore. Loss of love, of money, of possession, of security. No more. Security.

I'm certain most people have the same desires. So: why is it so damned difficult for me to express it? I used to pride myself on my communication skills, but in the last few years, they've seemed to atrophy and fail me.

Now that I've written this... I have no idea if I'll even post it.

I'm a fucking coward.

I'm so goddamned wrapped up in who I want people to perceive me as, what I want to be for them, that anything that makes me seem craven or weak, or decadent, or asshole-ish, I want to hide it from view.

I think that includes Manda.

There was a time -- ten years ago, or thereabouts -- when I would have hit "post" on this thing and not looked back. A lot of people would have commented sympathetic notes, a few would say, "what a self-centered fucking moron," and ... there it would have been. But now, I don't even know what I want to **say **publicly.
