One would think that being awake at 3:00 am on a Wednesday would lend itself to a bit of introspection. To prime the pump, I’m rolling out a bit from my past. You might see this a bit more fleshed out in the coming months. Until tomorrow night…</em></p><p>Blink.</p><p>There’s chaos all around me, as police are swarming into a parking lot, with nightsticks drawn and attack dogs barking.</p><p>The first music I remember listening to was on an 8-track tape in 1974. It was Cat Stevens’ “Tea For The Tillerman.” I couldn’t tell you the names of any of the songs on the tape, but what I can tell you is I was hungry for a lot more.</p><p>Six years later, I bought my first album with money I had saved up from allowance cash. When I was at Eckerd’s Drug with my mom, she let me pick out the album. I poured over the racks for a good ten minutes before choosing James Brown’s “Live at the Apollo.” The cover art was the deciding factor, since I had no idea what any of the music was, but when I got home and took the vinyl out of its shrink-wrapped holster, Kid Dynamite whacked me in the back of the head with a two-by-four.</p><p>When I started listening to radio for music in 1980, my tastes were firmly in the pop music of the era. Disco had already begun its quick decline, and New Wave was the order of the day. North Texas was one of the first markets for MTV, and the bands being played on the fledgling network were in heavy rotation on Dallas radio as well. I wouldn’t get MTV until 1983, but my friend Robby Youngblood did have the channel on constantly in his room. That was how I got my first taste of bands like Missing Persons, Duran Duran and the Talking Heads.</p><p>I was exceptionally lucky – my family was really open-minded when it came to the music I listened to. In the south, it would have been really easy to forbid me to listen to “devil music” or anything of the sort. Some of my friends didn’t have it as easy, and I ended up being a conduit for some of them to hear bands at my house, free from prying ears.</p><p>When Missing Persons came to Dallas, they played the Agora Ballroom, a smallish club that saw a lot of good shows in the decade they were open. I begged my mother to take me to the show – I mean, I was annoying to the point where if she would have dropped me in the river with a sack of wet cement, no court would have convicted her. She finally agreed (for no good reason other than to shut me up) and ushered me into the club for my first rock show.</p><p>I wasn’t prepared for the volume, the people, the smoke, or the way my life would change. If the first band you see has a lead singer wearing clear plastic globes on her breasts and electrical tape accenting the remainder of her outfit, your bar for what is considered “outrageous” is set fairly high. Had I gone to a different show for the first time, such as Toto or Kansas, I might have come away from it differently. Even on a small stage, Dale Bozzio’s theatrics and stagework stunned me. Her disaffected Southern California squeaking was mesmerizing.</p><p>(I know for a fact I’m not doing it justice. Lester Bangs said it best: “Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.”)</p><p>If my first show was mind-blowing, my second show was cerebellum-shattering. Queen was coming through town in 1981, one of the few times they would ever perform on US soil. “News of the World” was a record I positively wore out, and the begging and pleading begun anew for Mom to take me to the Longhorn Ballroom. Mom was familiar with the place, and had less of a problem taking me there.</p><p>To give you an idea of the complete mismatch of band to venue, know this: Freddie Mercury was in the checkerboard harlequin outfit that night. When he hit the stage with the rest of the band, I heard someone to my right yell to his buddy in a thick Central Texas drawl, “See, I told you he was a faggot.”</p><p>I didn’t care what anyone else was saying. I was locked in to the band. There was very little interplay between the band members, mostly due to the looks on their faces that said they could not wait to get the hell out of the south. Mercury didn’t look like he cared one atom. He owned the stage, prancing around like a gentleman dandy straight out of the Renaissance.</p><p>My dad didn’t know Mom was taking me to these shows, and would have blown a proverbial gasket had he found out. When he took me to my first large concert (Rush at Reunion Arena, in 1982, for the “Subdivisions” tour), he thought I was borderline too young. He acquiesced when I agreed to go with Tammy, the daughter of the woman he was seeing.</p><p>That Rush show was the first time I got a contact buzz from all of the pot smoke. Whether my dad knew I would get a head full of second-hand marijuana smoke or not, I’ll never know. He did give a bit of a knowing smile when I pleaded with him to get me some food on the way home, from anywhere at all.</p><p>And I discovered something while writing this chapter: my father was the one who bought the Cat Stevens 8-track. My dad. The one who was such an authoritarian while I was growing up; the one who hated it when I grew my hair down past my collar; the one who made big toys that killed people for a living.</p><p>Apparently, Dad had his hippie side as well, in the late ’60s to early ’70s. When he was running around in northern Colorado with my uncle, in the midst of a bunch of long-haired Mother Nature smokers, some of it must have rubbed off on him as well. It’s stunning to me, and opens up a whole new side of our relationship.</p><p>Eventually, my kids will be as shocked to know that I had a couple of years as a full-fledged headbanger. In the mid-80s, I switched gears from Rush, Toto and Journey to Judas Priest, WASP and Iron Maiden. I had the studded bracelets (but not the ones with spikes, since they cost too much and I knew I would put someone’s eye out), bandanas, baseball jersey tees with the sleeves cut off, and a head full of hair that constantly bobbed.</p><p>My partners in hard rock were Ben Hamby and Llano Collier, two guys who lived down the street from me. Llano had the “cool room,” something that one guy in every circle of friends has to have. He had the great Maiden posters with Eddie reaching out to steal your soul away, pictures of Randy Rhoads, Eddie Van Halen and Blackie Lawless, and at least one bitchin’ guitar that he was learning to play. Dehru Cromer was in a different neighborhood, but hung out as well. Dehru (who changed his name to Ted at some point, slipping it by everyone) went on to go onstage at Will Rogers Coliseum to play guitar for one song with U2 in 1987.</p><p>I would like to think we were bad asses, but the music was the hardest thing about us. Llano got in the most trouble at school, wearing an American flag sleeveless t-shirt and calling himself “Uncle Sammy” when a Vietnam Vet teacher took issue with it. Llano either didn’t give a fuck what anyone thought of him, or made a very good show of not caring. Ben was the son of the counselor at DeSoto Junior High, so it was almost impossible for him to get away with anything. The most trouble I got in involved a Bob Seger concert shirt that might have been too suggestive, and I had to wear it inside out.</p><p>Everything started to intersect in 1984, when Van Halen booked three dates to close out the American leg of their tour. I had gotten a line stub for the early morning when the tickets would go on sale, and my father and I went to stand in line for the tickets on a chilly April morning.</p><p>I’m fairly certain we were the only two people in our immediate vicinity who weren’t drunk, stoned, or both. The red-rimmed eyes, slurred speech and stumbling gave most of our linemates away.</p><p>The tickets went on sale at 5:00 am. They called the first group of numbers –</p><p>– and everyone started running towards the front door of TicketMaster’s office. The agents must certainly have freaked out, because the policed were called in riot gear. With dogs. It wasn’t a full-fledged riot – nothing was broken or set on fire, but it was a madhouse nevertheless.</p><p>Dad took one look at what was happening and said, “Let’s get the hell out of here.” I agreed, and we were making our way out of the area. I suppose I wasn’t moving fast enough for one Dallas policeman, who gave me a tap with his nightstick to usher me along. It bruised up fairly well, but neither my dad nor I thought it would have been classified as “unnecessary force.” In today’s litigious society, we probably would have sued his ass.</p><p>The tickets were eventually sold by mail order, and if you mailed in your line stub you got the best seats available in sequence. The seats were decent, and the show was phenomenal. We didn’t know it at the time, but that show was the final time Van Halen performed onstage with David Lee Roth fronting the band in America.</p><p>I idolized Roth – he was everything a dumb teenager wanted to be. Long hair, smooth with the ladies, great rock yelp. I wanted to be him so badly that I learned how to do splits, toe touches, and sweeping high kicks. For Halloween that year, I got Ben, Keith Black and Sheridan Smith to make up a Van Halen lip sync band, and we performed at my church. (Yes, I know it sounds convoluted and stupid. Don’t judge me!)</p><p>North Texas was incredibly lucky – in the 80s, there were great rock radio stations coexisting side-by-side with groundbreaking R&B stations and strong top 40 stations. The deejays were legendary: Redbeard, Bo & Jim, Jill Savage, Sally Diamond, Kidd Kraddick (before he got the cushy, nationally syndicated Clear Channel morning show, he worked afternoon drive time at KEGL). This was really the last true period of strong stations that weren’t afraid to break new music; Clear Channel hadn’t started gobbling up properties, and deejays weren’t homogenous, interchangeable spokespeople.</p><p>Between those great stations and MTV, I was exposed to a wide variety of music. Friends would come to me in high school, asking what the next big hit would be. I wasn’t really good at predicting what would be a hit, but I knew what I liked. I was touting “The Boys of Summer” by Don Henley, “What You Need” by INXS, and “Right On Track” by the Breakfast Club weeks before they were in heavy rotation on radio or TV.</p><p>Regardless of how out of vogue they are, I will continue to have a soft spot for the bands of my youth. My affection for Journey is constantly ridiculed by my friends, but the music on just about every one of their albums is music that still stands up today. When I was in the hospital for three months in 1983, I couldn’t fall asleep without listening to at least one side of ’Escape’ or ’Frontiers’ on my portable cassette player, low enough to hear. (When I checked out, the charge nurse commented they’d miss Steve Perry’s voice at night, so I guess it wasn’t quite low enough.)</p><p>I was bound and determined to do something related to music in whatever career I chose. What I didn’t know was how much music would matter.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">Musique Nonstop</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
