<p>I’ve admired Slade for over two decades, when I first heard him drumming for The Firm. Slade will be the first person to tell you his technique is horrible, in that he doesn’t have any. He got his start learning to play drums on his own, with no formal training. When a touring act came into town and needed a drummer, Slade went in and performed the Ventures’ “Walk, Don’t Run” and got the job on the spot. He went on to perform with Tom Jones, Manfred Mann, Asia, and most notably AC/DC.</p><p>I originally went to RRFC to play drums, but there was one problem: my kick drum skills have deteriorated over the 17 years I’ve been away from a kit. Additionally, when I was rehabbing from my knee surgery, my ankles have lost a lot of their strength, so when I was on beat with the kick, there was very little power behind it. With one simple adjustment, Slade looked at what I was doing and doubled the strength in my kick. That’s what separates good instructors from great ones - the ability to make simple adjustments that improve performance.</p><p>While we were working through whatever songs our band would perform that night onstage at the House Of Blues, Kip Winger found out I could sing. Over the morning of rehearsals, Kip pulled me from behind the drum kit and put me up front. When Kip Winger tells you, “There is no reason why you shouldn’t be fronting a band - you’re a natural,” it’s high praise.</p><p>This is Winger’s third stint with RRFC, and he’s the lead counselor for RRFC On Tour. He’s a natural leader, and when he figured out everyone’s level of competency, he wasted no time in raising the bar on us all. Timing and phrasing would be tightened, and little mistakes would be corrected in short order. By lunch, we had a three-song set that was precise, and ready to hit the stage.</p><p>At one point, while we were running through Journey’s “Any Way You Want It,” Winger saw that my throat was tightening up, and he stopped the band. Walks over, and starts digging his thumbs into my jawline. He tells me, “Relax. You’ve got a long day ahead of you, and you’re gonna knock ‘em dead. Pace yourself.”</p><p>About thirty minutes later, Mark Slaughter, another camp counselor, poked his head into the room where we were rehearsing. (There was a lot of that going on, where we all wanted to get a peek at the other bands coalescing in the third floor ballrooms of the Sheraton Dallas.) Slaughter listened for a minute or two, then came over and gave me a couple of pointers on where to tighten up one of the vocal sections of the song.</p><p>Then, on a break, Slaughter comes over and asks me to pop my head into Gilby Clarke’s camp room. His band of campers was running through “Crazy Train,” but they needed a vocalist to make the song pop. Slaughter motioned me over to the mic, and I picked the song up midway through. After finishing, Clarke wanted to know if I would sit in with their band on “Crazy Train,” and I said I would do it if I could also sing “Surrender,” a song every reader of this blog will recognize as one I have a deep emotional connection to.</p><p>In addition to chipping in vocals on the Six Pistols’ “Crazy Train” and “Surrender,” there was my band, Masters of Nun. We performed “Any Way You Want It,” “Mississippi Queen” by Mountain, and “All Right Now” by Free. There’ll be video of the band’s set in about a month, when the RRFC folks send me the DVD of that day’s Campapalooza. Until then, you’ll have to go by one person’s account of our performance that night:</p><blockquote><p>I really didn’t know what to expect from the whole camp thing, and went just because you wanted me there. But, I was really surprised - your band was fantastic. Each of your guitarists was on top of their game, and your singing was the best I’ve ever heard you do. You kicked ass.</p></blockquote><p>After our set, I hung out at the bar with Sladey, where I introduced him to Maker’s Mark and he talked with Manda about the day’s festivities. One thing about Slade: he has a steel trap for a mind when it comes to people’s names. I introduced them before our set, and hours later he still remembered her name in conversation. Ridiculous. As King’s X was preparing to go on, Slade turns to me and says, “You really did well out there today. It was a pleasure playing with you.”</p><p>If I’ve stopped smiling yet, it’s only been temporarily.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">Reachin&#x27; For The Sky, And Tearin&#x27; Up The Ground</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
