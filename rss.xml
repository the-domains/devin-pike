            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A New Start</h1><p>I haven't been keeping up with my personal site in quite a few months. Part of that comes from not doing much writing outside of extended posts on Facebook. (I'll let your snickering and eye-rolling die down. Okay. Moving on.) Part of my list of things I wanted to accomplish in 2016 was to revitalize my creative process, redo my site, and start writing again, to get a few of these things rattling around in my head out into the wild..</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bda70168b08003f227a1bb5ac699d5429ed652b9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Up All Night</h1><p>Two weeks ago, I was pleased to see three guys go after the Guinness World Record for longest TV watching marathon, by chain-watching all six seasons of “Lost” prior to the series finale. This gave me the notion to try and break a record I’ve had in my sights for quite a while: the Longest On-Air Radio Shift.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Musique Nonstop</h1><p>I’ve said repeatedly, to myself and others, that I will start writing more here very soon. One would think that being awake at 3:00 am on a Wednesday would lend itself to a bit of introspection. To prime the pump, I’m rolling out a bit from my past. You might see this a bit more fleshed out in the coming months. Until tomorrow night…</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Goodnight, Steve</h1><p>The first time I used an Apple computer was in Randy Vonderheid’s Journalism class at DeSoto High School, in 1986. Mr. V had seen the writing on the wall, and knew that the future workplace for writers and newspaper folk would be digital. Sure, we knew how to use the pica pole to measure out headline distances, and proportion wheels to properly crop and size photographs… but those days would be in the past, not the future. Programs like the first version of Aldus’ PageMaker would be the way things went from here on out.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Goodnight, Sharon</h1><p>In my dream, she’s picking me up from the airport, like she did on that Summer day in 1993. She looks at me, with that knowing smile, and all I can do is sigh. It was good to be home. It was good that she was the one that I saw first.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't We All?</h1><p>I keep going back to the Doctor Who’s episode (reboot Series Six, ep four) “The Doctor’s Wife.” It’s Neil Gaiman’s writing, which would make me happy regardless. However, there’s one bit of dialogue between Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill that I simply love. It encompasses Smith’s tenure as The Doctor:</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d987f3814954c8fd10e36bd8498614cdfd75cc69.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Prove It All Night</h1><p>We’ve got the technology, on a consumer level, to create some amazing entertainment. For $30,000, we can shoot, edit and distribute feature-length films that are ready to go on a big screen. This also allows fans who take issue with the cut and clarity of existing films and TV shows to go in and alter the tone, pacing and content of anything, from THE PHANTOM MENACE and STAR TREK: THE FINAL FRONTIER to the final episodes of LOST and HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.</p></article>]]></description>
