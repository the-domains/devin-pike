            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A New Start</h1><p>I haven't been keeping up with my personal site in quite a few months. Part of that comes from not doing much writing outside of extended posts on Facebook. (I'll let your snickering and eye-rolling die down. Okay. Moving on.) Part of my list of things I wanted to accomplish in 2016 was to revitalize my creative process, redo my site, and start writing again, to get a few of these things rattling around in my head out into the wild..</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bda70168b08003f227a1bb5ac699d5429ed652b9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Duality Of Leonard Nimoy]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Duality Of Leonard Nimoy</h1><p>With all of the STAR TREK cast members I’ve had the sheer pleasure of meeting over the years, the only time I had a chance to speak with Leonard Nimoy was during his 2010 appearance at Dallas Comic Con. I was doing some studying up on a panel (I think it was the FLASH panel with John Wesley Shipp and Amanda Pays), when Nimoy stopped into the Green Room for a break. Knowing it was likely my only time where I’d see him that weekend, I waited for an appropriate moment (where he wasn’t eating or drinking anything), introduced myself, and asked about his love of photography.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f1f2295c6152a10ddcddcd02de837f1f1d075898.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Forgetting To Remember</h1><p>History isn’t written in an instant. We’d like to think so, these days. “Best Something EVER,” we’ll say about a performance, or a film, or a t-shirt.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Reachin' For The Sky, And Tearin' Up The Ground</h1><p>It’s Wednesday night, and I’m sweating up a storm. Most likely, it was because I had been drinking a preponderous amount of water since 11:00 am. Maybe it was because I was on stage, with a lot of hot lights. Maybe it was because there were a few hundred people cheering my performance. Or maybe it was because I was onstage at the House Of Blues, rocking out in a way few people get to in their lives.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/491ddc21c2f0493b4aa5a3d8bfc390272e8a42f6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
