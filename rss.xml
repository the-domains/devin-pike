            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A New Start</h1><p>I haven't been keeping up with my personal site in quite a few months. Part of that comes from not doing much writing outside of extended posts on Facebook. (I'll let your snickering and eye-rolling die down. Okay. Moving on.) Part of my list of things I wanted to accomplish in 2016 was to revitalize my creative process, redo my site, and start writing again, to get a few of these things rattling around in my head out into the wild..</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bda70168b08003f227a1bb5ac699d5429ed652b9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rebel, Rebel</h1><p>The most ridiculous thing about the way I found out about David Bowie’s death was the first notice, where a notorious death hoax site published a note saying not that he had passed, but that it was a hoax that he had died. Instead, we learned within the hour that the man had fought a battle with cancer for over a year, and was gone. There’s something really intriguing about the “not a hoax” hoax of it, because it was so improbable that David Bowie had the capability — or, more importantly, our permission — to leave us.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/724f0c5ae99f302f581a5bf25507b05b073e6b57.jpg"></article>]]></description>
