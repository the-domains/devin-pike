            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A New Start</h1><p>I haven't been keeping up with my personal site in quite a few months. Part of that comes from not doing much writing outside of extended posts on Facebook. (I'll let your snickering and eye-rolling die down. Okay. Moving on.) Part of my list of things I wanted to accomplish in 2016 was to revitalize my creative process, redo my site, and start writing again, to get a few of these things rattling around in my head out into the wild..</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bda70168b08003f227a1bb5ac699d5429ed652b9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Push Pin</h1><p>The weird thing is, I’ve written this post several dozen times in my head over the last couple of months. However, by the time I get to a computer, there’s something else to do, and I put it off until later.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Reachin' For The Sky, And Tearin' Up The Ground</h1><p>It’s Wednesday night, and I’m sweating up a storm. Most likely, it was because I had been drinking a preponderous amount of water since 11:00 am. Maybe it was because I was on stage, with a lot of hot lights. Maybe it was because there were a few hundred people cheering my performance. Or maybe it was because I was onstage at the House Of Blues, rocking out in a way few people get to in their lives.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/491ddc21c2f0493b4aa5a3d8bfc390272e8a42f6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Goodnight, Isis</h1><p>Finally out of the old apartment, after a long night of steam cleaning, throwing away stuff that neither of us had used in years, and one Queen Amidala standee bequeathed to our former next-door neighbor, who turned 21 last night. How that thing will be defiled, I don’t even think I want to know, but at least it’ll have a new home.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ec4d61959ffe694a84d5ce8fa2fa20ccb4cd22ff.jpg"></article>]]></description>
