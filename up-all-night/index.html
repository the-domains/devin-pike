By the end of Pugs’ show, right around noon, I was begging for death.

Around 6:00 pm, I woke back up, had dinner with Manda, watched the majority of the Rangers / Rays game, then crashed again, waking up at 7:00 am Saturday.</p><p>Kids, there’s a moral to this story – and I’m mostly telling it to myself, to document this little escapade for the part of me that, around November, will start thinking of the six day radio shift for charity (and to set the record in the process). Because I know myself. Too well. By Halloween or so, I’ll start thinking “if I can prepare properly, and do a lot of caffeination, I can make it through a week.”</p><p><strong>No, Future Devin, you bloody well <em>can not</em>.</strong></p><p>You’re going to be 40 years old in a month, and you simply can not handle the physical strain on that kind of level. It’s a wonderful idea, and one that would be a great PR stunt for whatever projects you find yourself entwined in at that time. You’d likely raise a lot of money for whatever charity you attached yourself to. <strong>However</strong>, you’re overweight, have had a couple of heart issues, and aren’t built for that kind of marathon.</p><p>Perhaps, if you start preparing now – by losing the weight <em>and keeping it off</em>, doing some light jogging and the weight training that you have the equipment for in your garage yet collects dust and boxes – you can think about this for December 2011.
